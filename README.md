# Project-Oni-FSM-AI
A group project that I personally contributed to, I covered the AI in this project

The goal of the project was to, as a group, was to create a stealth/horror game, where the player acted as the “Bad guy”. The player needed to escape the map while choosing if it was worth killing guards while doing so. The game would react based on the number of guards killed, if more guards are killed in one level, more will spawn in the next level.

My contribution to this project was programming the AI and their perception system.
